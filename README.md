# Sea of Green Starter Kit

This project is a set of files with which to start your [Sea of Green](http://sea-of-green.com) web projects. It includes the baseline Sass files to start a project as well as favicons, logos, and a basic homepage (which is a great start to your <code>HTML</code> as well).

### Logos & Favicons

In the <code>/assets</code> directory, you will find the logos for Sea of Green, [Hands-on Hydro](http://handsonhydro.tumblr.com), and the Green Member program. All logos &amp; lockups are available as <code>.png</code>s with transparency as well as vector formats (<code>.ai</code> &amp; <code>.svg</code>).

The <code>/images</code> directory contains an ungodly amount of favicons as well as an <code>.svg</code> file that contains all Sea of Green &amp; Green Member logos as <code>SVG</code> symbols.

### Stylesheets

Sea of Green uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) with [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) &amp; [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io) for stylesheets. We use a 6-1 architecture based on [Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) with a [BEM](http://bem-info.org) naming scheme. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) handles our compilation, compression &amp; concatenation needs (there's a default <code>gulpfile.js</code> located in the root folder).
